 Yarnscript Parser and Interpretor for native gdscript support

 I hadn't seen any native Godot parser and interpretors that capture the "functional" capabilities of Juju Adam's "Chatter Box" so I've decided to make my own.

 This is currently a work in progress so I will make documentation and such as I get closer to a 1.0 release.
